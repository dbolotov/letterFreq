## letterFreq

A Shiny app that plots relative English frequencies given user input.


##TODO

- experiment with different layouts and colors
- add a "None" option to reference freqs
- clean up plot axis and legend
- increase size of input text box
- write description and guide
- change ref freq selector to radio buttons
- redraw plot when new reference is selected (so do not need to click button); button should be only for user text
- add another reference freq
- add textbox with data source references
